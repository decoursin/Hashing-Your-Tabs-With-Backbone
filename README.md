Hashing Your Tabs
=================

SPA example creating tabs that reflect and update location.hash using the following technology:
- Jquery
- Backbone.js
- Require.js
- Bootstrap.js

When a user clicks a tab, the page does not reload and the URL is appended by a hash. The hash is used to save state, so when the user clicks the back or forward button, the tabs, menu, and url are updated to reflect the change.
